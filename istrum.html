    <b>ISTRUM</b> is a preprocessor for <a href='strummer.html'>STRUMMER</a> which 
    provides an alternate event syntax.  Strummer
    relies heavily on keyword 'tags' for event parameters.  Istrum (the I is
    for <i>implicit</i>) uses the parameter values directly to determine the
    parameter type.   As a concrete example, strummer requires the sequence
    <b>':chord&nbsp;[min]'</b> to specify a minor chord.  Whereas istrum knows [min] is a
    chord and has no need for the :chord keyword.

  <p class="summery">ISTRUM and MAKE-ISTRUM are identical except the former binds the new part

    ISTRUM and MAKE-ISTRUM take the same set of keywords as
    STRUMMER.  See the STRUMMER page for details.

  <pre class="description">
    
    The ISTRUM event-list is a nested list of event specifications.  With
    exception of the first two elements of an individual event, the order of
    parameters is not important.  Each event has a time specification as the
    first element and a keynumber as the second.
    
         (time key ...)
    
    <b>Time</b> is always the first element of an event and must be in a format expected by the <a href='cue-functions.html'>cue function.</a>  
         The default is a list of form (BAR BEAT SUBBEAT).
         There are a few special cases.
    
         <b>=</b>  - indicates to reuse the previous time.
         <b>+</b>  - increment time by the same amount as the previous two times.
    
         ((1 1 1) ...)        ;; event at bar 1 beat 1
         ((1 2 1) ...)        ;; next event at beat 2
         (+       ...)        ;; third event at beat 3, the difference of the previous two.
         (=       ...)        ;; also at beat 3. 
    
    <b>Key number</b> is always the 2nd event element.  Ultimately it is up to the instrument's 
        <a href='keynumber-maps.html'>keynumber-map</a> to interpret the keynumber.   Special cases:
    
        <b>=</b>   - reuse the previous key.
        <b>r</b>   - the rest symbol r may be used to suppress output for the event.
        
        Numbers of form <b>n+</b> and <b>n-</b> transpose the previous key by &plusmn;n steps.
        Transpose may only be used if the predicate KEYNUMBER-P would return true for the previous 
        key.
    
        Otherwise the keynumber may be anything the instrument's keynumber-map recognizes.
    
    <b>Chords</b> are recognized as either as a valid name in the <a href='chords.html'>chord model</a> or as a list of keynumber offsets.
    
        [min]    - a minor chord by name.
        (0 3 7)  - a minor chord by template.
    
        There is a complication.  Some chord-models interpret a chord template not as a list of offsets, but 
        as a list of absolute keynumbers.   The default chord-model uses a template list as keynumber offsets. 
    
        (0 3 7) for keynumber 60 produces the minor chord at key 60,  c5 e5 g5
    
        The guitar-chord plugin treats a template list as absolute keynumber.  (0 3 7) is still a minor chord, 
        but it will be in octave 0, c0 e0 g0. 
     
    <b>Chord Inversions</b> are specified by symbols of form <b>:INV-N  :INV+N  and  :INV-OFF</b> where n is a small integer.
        
        :INV+1   - first inversion
        :INV-2   - second downward inversion 
        :INV-OFF - turn off inversions. 
    
    <b>Added Chord Octave</b>  The symbols <b>:OCT-  :OCT+  and  :OCT-OFF</b> describe if an extra octave is added to a chord.
    
        For :OCT+ the lowest note is repeated an octave higher.
            :OCT- the highest note is repeated an octave lower.
            :OCT-OFF turns off octave notes.
    
        The extra notes are added after any chord inversion.
    
        (0 3 7)               ;; original chord   produces   (0 3 7)
        (0 3 7) :inv+1        ;; first inversion  produces   (3 7 12)
        (0 3 7) :inv+1 :oct+  ;; added octave     produces   (3 7 12 15) 
    
    
    <b>Strum delay</b>  a floating point number sets the delay between successive chord notes.
         
         (time key (0 3 7) 0.01 ...)  produces a chord at given time with a delay 0f 0.01 seconds
         between each note    
                                  key+0 at time 
                                  key+3 at time + 0.01
                                  key+7 at time + 0.02
    
    
    <b>Strum direction</b> the symbols <b>:DOWN  :UP  :RAND  and  :RAND-UP</b> determine the order chord notes are played.
         
         :DOWN    - notes are played in order.
         :UP      - note are played in reverse order.
         :RAND    - notes are played in random order.
         :RAND-UP - either up or down order is selected randomly.
         :UP-DOWN - alternate up and down
         :down-up - alternate down and up
    
    <b>Strum End Time</b>   The symbols <b>:ETOG  and  :ETOG-OFF</b> indicate if strummed notes should all 
        end at the same time, or be staggered in the order they were played.
    
        :ETOG      - notes end together.
        :ETOG-OFF  - note off times are staggered.
    
    <b>Dynamics</b>  Any <a href='dynamics.html'>dynamic</a> symbol sets note amplitude.
    
    <b>Duration</b>  Any <a href='metrics.html'>metric-expression</a> sets note duration.
    
    <b>Program changes</b> are specified by <b>:PROG-nnn</b>.  Ultimately it is up to the instruments <a href='program-maps.html'>program-map</a> 
        to process the program number.
